CodeGenerating is a library which aims to improve generating haskell, as
represented by the haskell-src-extspackage. The package is very unstable
and immature.

The package currently has two major parts. In Code.Generating.Utils there
are a lot of helper function for creating source. This is the most stable
part of the library. The second part of the library is the ModuleBuilder
found in Code.Generating.ModuleBuilder, which tries to make module and
package building easier through wrapping the StateT monad into the 
ModuleBuilder monad.
